# Reliable Event Processing — Project Rules

## Non-negotiable scope boundaries (M1)
- Do not add retry/backoff/DLQ/attempts/parallelism unless explicitly requested by the current issue.
- Do not add new job states beyond: queued, in_progress, done, failed.
- Do not add ingestion deduplication (no UNIQUE constraints on external_event_id) unless explicitly requested.

## Implementation style
- Prefer explicit, minimal code over abstractions.
- For DB interactions, use raw SQL via pg Pool unless explicitly requested to introduce an ORM.

## Dependency/version consistency
- Do not change dependency versions unless explicitly requested.
- Keep @types/node aligned with the root workspace version.

## Logging
- Avoid log spam in loops: do not emit per-tick info logs.
- Prefer state-transition logs: started, claimed, done, failed, idle-enter.---
